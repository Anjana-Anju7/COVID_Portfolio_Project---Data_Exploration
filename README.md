#COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project aims to explore and analyse COVID-19 data using SQL queries.It utilises various SQL techniques such as joins,CTE, temp tables, window functions,
aggregate functions and creating views to extract insights from the data.

Data Analysis using SQL Queries

1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths:  Analyses the likelihood of dying if one contracts COVID in a specific country
2. Total Cases vs population: Shows the percentage of population infected with COVID.
3. Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
4. Countries with Highest Death Count per Population: Lists countries with the highest death count per population.
5. Breaking Things Down by Continent: Examines continents with the highest death count per population.
6. Global Numbers: Provides global statistics on total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
7. Total Population vs Vaccinations: Shows the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
8. Creating View: Sets up a view for storing data for later visualization.
